# Whodunnit â€” A programming mystery

_It hopefully should be obvious from the phrasing, but if not, be aware that
the following is a fictional account of a situation. Also, the software in this
repository obviously has bugs and you should only run it in a virtual machine
or if you are confident you know what you are doing. I take no responsibility
for any NPC casualties._

The ever-optimistic Acme Corporation came up with an incredible plan to
devastate their rivals. They would offer something radically new and
innovative: Division as a service. Users would connect to a remote machine
running their custom software and then, like gods, divide any two numbers of
their choosing. Sales and Marketing projected a first quarter profit of around
eleventy bazillion monies. Champagne was poured. Backs were patted.

Half a year later and Acme are onto release 2.0 with support for more hardware
and even division by zero. Uptake has been somewhat slower than forecasted and
suddenly reports are rolling in about machines running their software being
repeatedly compromised. Their devs are stumped as they reinstall machines and
hours later find them once again part of a botnet. The mood around the office
is bleak.

Enter an intrepid detective (you). Can you solve the case of the errant
divider?
